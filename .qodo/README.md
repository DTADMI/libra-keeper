echo '# .qodo Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for the LibraKeeper project.

## Files

- `config.json`: Main configuration file for project settings, scripts, and tooling.

## Purpose

The [.qodo](cci:7://file:///B:/git/libra-keeper/.qodo:0:0-0:0) directory is used to store configuration files and settings specific to the development environment. This helps maintain consistency across different development setups and ensures all team members are using the same configurations.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the project through the `.qodo/config.json` file:

- Project metadata (name, version, description)
- Scripts for development, building, and testing
- Styling preferences (Tailwind, CSS, PostCSS)
- Linting and formatting rules
- Git hooks
- Testing configurations

## Best Practices

1. Keep sensitive information out of these config files
2. Document any non-standard configurations
3. Keep the configuration files in version control
4. Update the documentation when making changes to the configuration' > README.md
